# Week 10 Notes

## I. Topics covered this week
This week, we will be looking over the [Adventure Game](../notes/HW-adventure.md) example, which contains some "good stuff" and might be a nice starting point for some of your projects. In particular, this exercise covers:

- [use strict;](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp)
- Tiling sprites in the DOM
- Keyboard controls
- Audio
- Arrays and game objects

## II. Project 2
Remember that project 2 is due at the end of this week. We will have some classtime available for discussion and work on it.
