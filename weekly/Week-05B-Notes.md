# Week 5B - Project 1 Critique
At this point, your Project 1 should be essentially done, maybe needing a few minor tweaks here and there. 
In an effort to improve it even further, today's class will be devoted entirely to project critiques. Critique is useful not only for you to receive and improve your work, but in the industry it's very important to be able to give good, constructive criticism, so we're going to be practicing here!

Everyone should gather into groups of 4, and complete the critique exercise linked below.
