## II. Midterm Exam

## III. Readings and Homework Assignment
As always, leep an eye on the myCourses dropboxes, both the descriptions and due dates. These will help you keep track of what is due/when, and what you should be working on.

## V. Project 2
Also remember that the proposal for [Project 2](../projects/project2.md) is due at the start of next week. For the proposal, submit a PDF containing the following:

- Your name and team member's name - one posting per team (team members are optional)
- What kind of project you would like to build - be as specific as you can: Web Service App (which service?) or DOM Game (what kind of game)
