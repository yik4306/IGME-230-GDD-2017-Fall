# Week 14A - SVG

## Topics
- Scalable Vector Graphics
- Vectors and animations in the browser

## SVG
[Scalable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/About.html), or SVG, is a standard supported by the W3C to draw vector graphics directly into the browser, much like Pixi does with pixels via WebGL (or like canvas does with pixels). SVG objects are DOM objects and can be manipulated like the rest of the DOM. SVG has its own syntax and rules, and SVG elements can be styled like anything else.

## Presentations
There are also a ton of JS libraries in common use nowadays, giving us external JS files with access to new functions and functionality. We've already seen jQuery for processing AJAX and handling some other issues. Some of these libraries help streamline our processes, like jQuery, some help us build JS-based responsive sites, like Angular and React, some even add additional capabilities, like Node.js which lets us do server-side JS programming.

## Exercise: Abstract Animation
Create an abstract animation. Use at least four different types of SVG elements in your composition. All SVG elements (with the exception of the container ```<svg>``` tag) should be dynamically added via JavaScript. Try to create at least two different “scenes”, moments where the animation changes in a significant way.

Place the resulting HTML file (and any external resources if needed) on Banjo and provide a link from your homepage, before next week's first class.

## Review questions
1. What is the difference between raster and vector graphics?
1. What are the advantages of SVG over other graphical methods in the browser?
