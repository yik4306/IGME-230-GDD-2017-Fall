## Instructions
1. Duplicate the **random-phrases-1.html** file and name it **random-phrases-2.html**
1. All of the requirements of Random Phrases-1 are in effect.
1. Create a nicely styled &lt;button> and put it on the screen. Feel free to search the web for appropriate button CSS styles.
1. Clicking the button will call a function named `displayQuote`, which will generate and display a random quote.
1. Add CSS button rules for `:hover` and :`active` so that the button has a nice "over" and "down" look.
1. When the page is first loaded, a random quote should still be displayed.

## Submission
- Post to your web site and link it from your home page before the due date. Also make sure to post to the dropbox.
- Hint: The coding of this should only take a minute, but the button styling will likely take more time.
