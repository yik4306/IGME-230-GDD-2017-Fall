# Project 3 - Sprite-based Game or Experience
Using PixiJS, create an interactive game or experience.

For this project you (and optionally a partner) are creating a JavaScript-driven web application or game using PixiJS, as you outlined in Project 1. You will be updating your site from Project 1 to focus on this game (or rewriting the content if you are changing your mind on what you're doing).

## I. Overview
- Your goal is to use PixiJS to create an interactive Media Experience or Game that is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.

- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.

- You will be evaluated:
    - on your creativity
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - your use and understanding of PixiJS
    - the soundness of your programming
    - and how far you went beyond what we did in class, as described below.

## II. Requirements

### A. Functional
- You will use PixiJS as your underlying graphics engine.
- Your game or app should do something useful, and be easy to use.
- There will be no JavaScript errors or exceptions thrown by the app.
- You must utilize some other HTML5 feature, like localStorage, drag and drop, or location services. 

Canvas and direct DOM manipulation (for the experience itself) are not allowed; you may utilize DOM manipulation for other aspects of your interface, but the purpose is to demonstrate your ability to implement the PixiJS library.

### B. Design & Interaction
- Pleasing graphic design
- Widgets are well labeled
- User should be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction (and be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary!), and user errors are handled gracefully.
- While it doesn't need to be responsive, it should look good on a range of displays; don't design it just to work on your huge screen at home. If my computer can't show the whole layout, it's a problem.

### C. HTML/CSS
- Valid HTML5 - https://validator.w3.org
- Valid CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- Most CSS is in an external style sheet.
- Use HTML5 semantic and structural elements where practical.

### D. Media
- Images are properly optimized for web delivery.
- Sound is used to enhance the experience

### E. Code Conventions
- `let` and `const` (no `var`!)
- `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` for DOM traversal (DO NOT use the older methods)
- Utilize at least one ES6 `class` of your own creation
- D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself. Repeated blocks of nearly identical code should be factored out and placed in a separate function.
- Separation of Concern. Similar to how the *Circle Blast! HW* was structured, have a separate .js file for your classes, utility functions, and main code. If you have more than 3 CSS rules, then put them in an external stylesheet.
- Variable and function names must begin with a lowercase letter.
- Well-commented code. Each and every function gets a comment indicating what it does.
- Delete or comment out your `console.log()` calls.

## Milestones
- By the start of class November 29 (for Prof. Boyle) or November 29 @ 11:59PM (for Prof. Jefferson) you will have updated your site from Project 1 to include a more accurate proposal of this game project.
- Final project deliverable is due during our scheduled final exam. There is no dropbox for this; update your site and make sure the working game/app is running on it. If you are working in a team, both team members need to update their sites.
- At our scheduled final exam time, we will have a show and tell of your projects (see below).

## Documentation
- Update the documentation on your Project 1 to include your process for this project, cite any sources, tell me where to find anything special you want me to see, and also explain how you met the requirements. Remember, this documentation is a **web page** linked on the project site, not a text file or some other format.
- If you worked in a pair, explain what each team member did. Remember, everyone is responsible for contributing throughout the project, not just to one aspect.

## Presentation
For Professor Boyle's sections, at the time of our scheduled meeting during finals week, you will present your project to the class in a brief demo. **Attendance for this is mandatory.** For this demo, show us:
- What you made
- What’s cool, and what you think is “above and beyond”
- How you overcame any serious challenges
- Your sources (for libraries, tutorials, etc.) if you used any

## Grading
- *Both* partners must contribute equally to the project. This is NOT a project where team members are allowed to specialize into "Art Director" and "Software Developer" roles! Both team members shall be "Artist/Coders" (doing both) for this project.

Your project will be graded on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Your Score |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **Functionality** | **20** | |
|  - Is useful and/or entertaining | |
|  - Demonstrates creativity | |
|  - Runs without errors | |
| **Design & Interaction** | **20** | |
|  - Visual design is pleasing | |
|  - Uses audio to enhance the experience | |
|  - Interface is clear and well labeled | |
|  - Prevents and handles errors well | |
| **Implementation and Code** | **20** | |
|  - Uses PixiJS for graphics and animations | |
|  - Only uses other libraries as necessary; primary functionality is done via your own code | |
|  - Uses an additional HTML5 technology | |
|  - Code is well formatted and commented, and follows coding standards | |
| **HTML/CSS/Media**  | **10** | |
|  - HTML and CSS validate | |
|  - CSS is primarily in a single external stylesheet | |
|  - Makes proper use of structural tags, etc. | |
| **Documentation** | **10** | |
| **Above and Beyond (see below)** | **10** | |
| **Presentation** | **10** | |
| **Possible Total Points** | **100** | |
| Deduction if proposal is not updated on time | -10 | |
| Deduction if project is not posted on Banjo where required | -100 | |

Note:
- **Good** (Meet all requirements above reasonably well) = 90%
- **Better** (Go beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 95%
- **Best** (Go significantly beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 100%

## Submission
- Update your project 1 content with all the relevant content for this project, including the game itself.

**If you do not post the project online where requested, and if the link from your main page doesn't work, you will receive a 0 for this project.**
