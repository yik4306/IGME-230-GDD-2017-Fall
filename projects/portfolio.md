# Portfolio Assignment

### Due Tuesday 11/21, by 11:59 PM
For this assignment, worth 5% of your class grade, you will be building a responsive, single-page "hire me" portfolio using a CSS framework of your choice.

You can use the following tutorial to build your portfolio:

(You can log into Lynda.com for free via the RIT library, or by following this link: https://shib.lynda.com/Shibboleth.sso/InCommon?providerId=https://shibboleth.main.ad.rit.edu/idp/shibboleth&target=https://shib.lynda.com/InCommon )

This tutorial covers several topics as a bit of review for us, as well as how to use the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) framework. You don't *have* to use it, but it would be my recommendation. Whether you use this tutorial, another, or none at all, your portfolio must meet the requirements outlined below.

## I. Overview

You are building a "hire me" portfolio where you can showcase your professional accomplishments. The purpose of the site is to display your relevant work and experiences, and enable interested employers to contact you. Your target audience is potential employers. This site should convince them you deserve an interview for a co-op or full-time job in your field. 

The focus of this assignment is to get as much of your portfolio content as possible online in an organized fashion. The site design should be clean and neat. The navigation system should be straightforward and intuitive to use. It should all be responsive and on a single page.

The typical content in any portfolio, as outlined in our lecture, should be reflected in the content and design of your site. Examples:
- Logo
- Tag Line
- Portfolio
- About Me
- Resume
- Contact

## II. Requirements

Your portfolio must meet the following requirements:

- Location: This will be located **outside** your 230 folder, so it will be clearer to employers that it is your portfolio and not work for a class. So, its location should be at *people.rit.edu/abc1234/portfolio* (where *abc1234* is replaced with your username).
- A single-page responsive design using a framework (not built by hand)
- Includes a recognizable, business-appropriate photo of you, as well as a personal logo
  - Your logo could be as simple as a circle containing your initials, or something more elaborate; use your Google-fu to find some guidance!
- Your contact info, including your email address and your city of residence
  - Make sure your email address itself is appropriate for business use, and also make sure the name that shows when you send emails (not just your signature) is your actual name, not a screen name or alias.
- "Safe" social media links
- A gallery of your work, using a lightbox or other interactive plugin such as [fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) to allow employers to see an overview of your work and get details on demand
- The whole site should adhere to our CRAP guidelines, with a pleasing and appropriate color scheme, and also use at least one embedded font
- Documentation: Cite all your sources in the footer of your page (you shouldn't have all that many).

You might not have a lot of work to showcase at this time, though you have a couple projects from this course. Your design should accommodate future additions, and might be best if categorized by project type. All projects should have images, and code projects should link to GitHub or some other repository so the code itself can be accessed.
