# Project 2 - Web App or DOM Game

For this project you (and optionally a partner) are creating a JavaScript driven web application or DOM game. Here are some examples that are realistically scoped:

- A tile-based game (based on the [Pixel Artist HW](../notes/HW-pixel-artist.md))
     - Minesweeper
     - a board game like Connect-4 or Othello
     - a maze game/adventure game that uses arrow keys to navigate
     - *Conway's Game of Life* - there is an optional HW assignment to get you started down this path if you want: [HW-life.md](../notes/HW-life.md)
- A dramatically enhanced Magnetic Poetry App (extends [Magnetic Poetry HW](../notes/HW-magnetic-poetry.md))
- A card or matching game based on the [Chibi Card Matching DOM Game](../notes/HW-chibi-matching.md) example from class.
- A Web Service App that extends what we did in the [GIF Finder HW](../notes/HW-gif-finder.md)
    - You can build the *Music Finder* app (solo only, no partners) - see the requirements here: [music-finder-project-example.md](_supporting-files/music-finder-project-example.md)
    - Or pick a web service, and then add more UI options so that it at a minimum meets the requirements of *Music Finder* above. Here are some [sample web services](_supporting-files/sample-web-services.md) (there are many others!).

## I. Overview
- Your goal is to create an interactive HTML5 Media Experience or DOM Game that is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.

- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.

- The objective of this project is for you to demonstrate your mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS programming in a rich media context. 

- You will be evaluated:
    - on your creativity
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - the soundness of your programming
    - and how far you went beyond what we did in class, as described below.

## II. Requirements

### A. Functional
This depends on what you are building:

- If it is web service app, it should at a miniumum have the features of the *Music Finder* application. 
- If it it some other kind of game or experience, it should do something useful, and be easy to use.
- There will be no JavaScript errors or exceptions thrown by the app.

### B. Design & Interaction
- Pleasing graphic design
- Widgets are well labeled
- User should be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction (and be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary!), and user errors are handled gracefully.
- While it doesn't need to be responsive, it should look good on a range of displays; don't design it just to work on your huge screen at home. If my computer can't show the whole layout, it's a problem.

### C. HTML/CSS
- Valid HTML5 - https://validator.w3.org
- Valid CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- Most CSS is in an external style sheet.
- Use HTML5 semantic and structural elements where practical.

### D. Media
- Images are properly optimized for web delivery.

### E. Code Conventions
- `let` and `const` (no `var`!)
- `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` for DOM traversal (DO NOT use the older methods)
- D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself. Repeated blocks of nearly identical code should be factored out and placed in a separate function.
- Variable and function names must begin with a lowercase letter.
- Well-commented code. Each and every function gets a comment indicating what it does.
- Delete or comment out your `console.log()` calls.

## Milestones
- Project proposal with mockup due in dropbox week 9 (see mycourses for due date/time). One submission per team please.
- Final project deliverable due end of week 10 (see mycourses for due date/time). One submission per team please.
- Final project documentation. Describe your contribution to the project, and give it a grade. Both partners must submit documentation.

## Documentation
- As with Project 1, include a Documentation page (linked from your project where I can find it) where you document your process, cite any sources, tell me where to find anything special you want me to see, and also explain how you met the requirements.
- If you worked in a pair, explain what each team member did. Remember, everyone is responsible for contributing throughout the project, not just to one aspect.

## Grading
- *Both* partners must contribute *both* JavaScript code AND HTML/CSS to the project. This is NOT a project where team members are allowed to specialize into "Art Director" and "Software Developer" roles! Both team members shall be "Artist/Coders" (doing both) for this project.

Your project will be graded on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Your Score |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **Functionality** | **40** | |
|  - Is useful and/or entertaining | |
|  - Demonstrates creativity | |
|  - Runs without errors | |
| **Design & Interaction** | **20** | |
|  - Visual design is pleasing | |
|  - Interface is clear and well labeled | |
|  - Prevents and handles errors well | |
| **HTML/CSS/Media**  | **10** | |
|  - HTML and CSS validate | |
|  - CSS is primarily in a single external stylesheet | |
|  - Makes proper use of structural tags, etc. | |
| **Code**  | **10** | |
|  - Code is well formatted and commented, and follows coding standards | |
| **Documentation** | **10** | |
| **Above and Beyond (see below)** | **10** | |
| **Possible Total Points** | **100** | |
| Deduction if initial checkpoint is not submitted to dropbox on time | -10 | |

Note:
- **Good** (Meet all requirements above reasonably well) = 90%
- **Better** (Go beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 95%
- **Best** (Go significantly beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 100%

## Submission
- ZIP and post the completed project and documentation page to to the mycourses dropbox
- Post the project to banjo and link it from your 230 home page (exception: do not post *Music Finder* to the web)
